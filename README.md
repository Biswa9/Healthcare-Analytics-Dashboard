1. Total Visits by Diagnosis
Visualization:
Type: Bar Chart
Description: Shows the number of visits for each diagnosis.
Analysis:
This chart helps identify which conditions are most prevalent among patients. If one diagnosis has a significantly higher number of visits, it might indicate a more common or urgent health issue within the dataset.
2. Average Cost by Diagnosis
Visualization:
Type: Bar Chart
Description: Displays the average cost associated with each diagnosis.
Analysis:
This chart reveals which diagnoses are the most expensive on average. A higher average cost may suggest more severe conditions requiring more extensive treatment or follow-up.
3. Visits Over Time
Visualization:
Type: Line Chart
Description: Illustrates the number of patient visits over time.
Analysis:
This line chart helps in tracking trends in patient visits. Peaks or troughs can indicate periods of higher or lower patient activity, which could correlate with external factors such as seasons or health events.
4. Total Cost Over Time
Visualization:
Type: Line Chart
Description: Shows the total cost of visits over time.
Analysis:
This chart tracks how the financial burden changes over time. Significant increases or decreases in total cost can signal shifts in treatment intensity or patient volume.
5. Age Distribution of Patients
Visualization:
Type: Histogram with KDE (Kernel Density Estimate)
Description: Shows the distribution of patient ages.
Analysis:
This histogram provides insight into the age demographics of the patient population. Peaks in certain age ranges can indicate the most common age groups receiving treatment.
6. Cost Distribution by Diagnosis
Visualization:
Type: Box Plot
Description: Displays the variability of visit costs for different diagnoses.
Analysis:
The box plot highlights the range, median, and potential outliers in costs for each diagnosis. This can be useful for understanding cost variability and identifying any exceptionally high or low-cost visits.
7. Correlation Heatmap
Visualization:
Type: Heatmap
Description: Shows the correlation between numerical variables (e.g., Age and Visit Cost).
Analysis:
This heatmap helps identify the strength and direction of relationships between variables. For instance, a strong positive correlation between age and cost might indicate that older patients incur higher costs.
8. Gender Distribution
Visualization:
Type: Bar Chart
Description: Illustrates the count of male and female patients.
Analysis:
This chart shows the distribution of patients by gender. It can help in understanding if there are any significant gender imbalances in the dataset.
